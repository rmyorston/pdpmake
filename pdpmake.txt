NAME
  pdpmake - Public domain POSIX make

SYNOPSIS
  pdpmake [--posix] [-ehiknpqrSst] [-C dir] [-f mkfile] [-j num_jobs]
          [-x pragma] [\fImacro\fP[::]=\fIvalue\fP ...] [\fItarget\fP ...]

DESCRIPTION
  The pdpmake utility creates or updates files following a set of rules.
  The created or updated files, called targets, are typically derived from
  other files, called prerequisites. Targets are derived according to
  rules describing file dependencies and listing commands to be executed.
  Rules may be inferred by the utility or explicitly defined in one or
  more makefiles.

OPTIONS
  -C dir     Change to dir before reading the makefiles or doing anything
             else. If multiple -C options are specified, each is
             interpreted relative to the previous one: '-C / -C etc' is
             equivalent to '-C /etc'.

  -e         Let environment variables override macro assignments within
             makefiles.

  -f mkfile  Specify a different makefile. The argument mkfile may be
             a path to a file, or a minus sign '-' for standard input.
             Multiple files may be specified and are read in that order.

  -h         Display help information.

  -i         Ignore non-zero exit codes returned by commands executed
             to rebuild files. This is equivalent to using the special
             target \fB.IGNORE\fP without prerequisites.

  -j num_jobs  Unused, provided only for compatibility.

  -k         Continue processing after errors are encountered, but only for
             targets that don't depend on the target whose creation
             caused the error.

  -n         Print commands that would have been executed, but don't
             actually execute them unless the command is prefixed with '+'.

  -p         Print the macro definitions and rules that result from reading
             the makefiles, then continue with any processing required.

  --posix    Enable strict POSIX-compliant mode.
             This option must be the first given on the command line.

  -q         Do  not  execute  any commands, instead exit 0 if the specified
             targets are up to date, and 1 otherwise.

  -r         Do not use the built-in rules. Clear the suffix list.

  -S         Stop processing if an error is encountered. This is the default
             behaviour and the opposite of -k.

  -s         Do not print the commands as they are executed. This is
             equivalent to using the special target \fB.SILENT\fP without
			 prerequisites.

  -t         Touch files instead of running the commands required to build
             them, but not for targets that have no commands or that are
             already up-to-date.

  -x pragma  Allow certain pdpmake extensions to apply in strict
             POSIX-compliant mode. For a list of supported pragmas
             see \fBPRAGMAS\fP below. Multiple -x options can be given.

  \fImacro\fP[::]=\fIvalue\fP  Assign \fIvalue\fP to \fImacro\fP, overriding
             the value of \fImacro\fP in the makefile, if it exists.
             Macro assignments and targets may be mixed on the command line.
             All assignments will be processed first, then the targets.

PRAGMAS
  macro_name       Allow '-' as a valid character in macro names.

  target_name      Allow '-' and '/' as valid characters in target names.

  command_comment  Don't treat the '#' character as introducing a comment
                   in commands or in target and inference rules.

  empty_suffix     Permit an empty suffix in macro expansions of the form
                   $(VAR:=.c).

  posix_2017       Enforce the current POSIX 2017 standard rather than the
                   future POSIX 202X.

  posix_202x       Enforce the future POSIX 202X standard rather than the
                   current POSIX 2017. In this case the \fBmacro_name\fP and
				   \fBtarget_name\fP pragmas aren't required as the future
				   standard allows the additional characters.

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

  pdpmake is a make utility following the POSIX standard:
  \fIhttps://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/make.html\fP
  
  The behavior of the utility should match the behavior described in the
  POSIX standard specification, while allowing a set of extensions for
  convenience. The behavior may be fine-tuned using command line options,
  environment variables, or special targets defined inside makefiles.
  
  By default pdpmake allows all extensions. To disable all extensions and
  enable strict POSIX-compliant mode, do any of the following:
  
        - Add the special target \fB.POSIX\fP as the first non-comment
        line in the first makefile to be processed. This is the standard
        approach for declaring a makefile to be POSIX-compliant.
        
        - Add the --posix flag as the first command line option given to
        pdpmake. This flag is unique to pdpmake and may not be available
        in other make utilities.
        
        - Set the \fBPDPMAKE_POSIXLY_CORRECT\fP environment variable
        to any value. This environment variable is unique to pdpmake
        and may not be available in other make utilities.
  
  While in strict POSIX-compliant mode, you may selectively enable certain
  extensions through the use of pragmas (see \fBPRAGMAS\fP).
  To use one or more pragmas, do any of the following:
  
        - Add -x \fIpragma\fP as a command line option given to pdpmake.
        Multiple -x options can be given. This flag is unique to pdpmake
        and may not be available in other make utilities.
        
        - Add the special target \fB.PRAGMA:\fP \fIpragma\fP to the first
        makefile to be processed. Multiple pragmas can be specified.
        This special target is unique to pdpmake and may not be available
        in other make utilities.
  
  pdpmake implements a set of extensions from the future POSIX standard as
  well as other make utilities. The set of available extensions are:
  
        - Nested macro expansion. e.g. $(FOO$(BAR))
        
        - Prerequisites of the \fB.PHONY\fP special target are always
        treated as being out-of-date.
        
        - More than one file can be specified on each include line.
        
        - Missing include files can be ignored by using -include \fIfile\fP
        instead of \fBinclude\fP \fIfile\fP.
        
        - Missing or out-of-date include files are rebuilt if an appropriate
        rule can be found.
        
        - The $^ and $+ internal macros evaluate to all prerequisites of the
        current target (not just out-of-date ones, as with $?). $^ removes
        duplicated prerequisites from the list, $+ doesn't.
        
        - If no \fBMAKE\fP environment variable is provided the \fBMAKE\fP
        macro is initialised from argv[0], with a relative path converted
        to absolute.
        
        - The macro assignments ::=, :::=, +=, ?= and != are permitted.
        
        - Pattern macros extend the standard suffix substitution in macro
        expansion to allow changes to prefixes as well.
        
        - An escaped newline within a macro expansion on a command line
        is replaced by a space.
        
        - The \fBCURDIR\fP macro is set to the current directory during
        program start up.
        
        - The -C directory command line option changes the current
        working directory.
        
        - Double colon rules are allowed.
        
        - The following conditional keywords are allowed: ifdef, ifndef,
        ifeq, ifneq, else, endif
        
        - Archive members can be specified using the form
        lib.a(mem1.o mem2.o...).
        
        - The macro assignment := is permitted. It is equivalent to ::=
        in POSIX.
        
        - Chained inference rules can be used when searching for the
        prerequisites of a target. Thus, if there are inference rules
        \fI.p.q\fP and \fI.q.r\fP and the file \fIthing.p\fP exists,
        make is able to deduce how to create \fIthing.r\fP.
        
        - The wildcards '*', '?' and '[]' can be used in the targets
        and prerequisites of target rules.
        
        - '#' on a command line or in a macro expansion doesn't indicate
        the start of a comment. In other locations '#' can be escaped by
        preceding it with a backslash.
        
        - Duplicated prerequisites are removed when the internal macro
        $? is expanded.
        
        - An \fBinclude\fP line with no files specified is silently ignored.
        At least one blank must follow the \fBinclude\fP for the line to
        be valid.
        
        - The shell used to process build commands isn't started with
        the -e option when errors aren't being ignored.
        
        - Macro definitions and targets may be mixed on the command line.
        The macro definitions are processed first, then the targets.
        
        - The $< and $* internal macros are given values in target rules.
        
        - When a build command receives a signal the target is removed.
